## Why this exists

[OrcDev](https://github.com/TheOrcDev) showed what is possible with [warcraftcn](https://www.warcraftcn.com/): a focused UI language that feels native to the game instead of generic web design.

In the decades-long rivalry of RuneScape vs Warcraft, both communities built legends. But web tooling around RuneScape deserved the same level of craft and identity. As a 20+ year RuneScape player, this project exists because RuneScape could not be left behind.

runescapecn brings OSRS visual DNA into reusable components: hard edges, beveled borders, local RuneStar fonts, and practical shadcn-style APIs so teams can build fast without losing the world feel.

## What's inside

- Pixel-perfect OSRS borders, beveled 3D shadows, and zero border-radius
- Authentic [RuneStar](https://github.com/RuneStar/fonts) fonts (CC0-1.0, public domain)
- 11 accessible components: Button, Card, Dialog, Select, Tabs, Input, Checkbox, Badge, Tooltip, Progress, CopyButton
- Built on React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI, and Class Variance Authority
- Copy-paste friendly — every component is a single file you own

## Registry Install (shadcn CLI)

```bash
